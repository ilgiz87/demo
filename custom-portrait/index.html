          <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when
            you visit or
            make a purchase from artifyu.com (the “Site”).</p>
          <h3>Personal information we collect</h3>
          <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device,
            including
            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are
            installed on your
            device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web
            pages or
            products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
            about how you
            interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
            Information”.</p>
          <h3>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an
              anonymous unique
              identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
              http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
            </li>
            <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
              browser type,
              Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
            </li>
            <li>“Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about
              how you browse
              the Site.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect
            certain
            information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment
            information (including
            credit card numbers, Paypal and Klarna information), e-mail address, and phone number. We refer
            to this
            information as “Order Information”.</p>
          <p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about
            Device
            Information and Order Information.</p>
          <p>How do we use your personal information?<br>We use the Order Information that we collect
            generally to fulfill
            any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for
            shipping, and
            providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order
            Information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Communicate with you;</li>
            <li>Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud;</li>
            <li>We never use the contact information (phone numbers or email addresses) you provide when
              placing an order
              to send spam.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in
            particular,
            your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
            generating analytics
            about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our
            marketing and
            advertising campaigns).</p>
          <p>We also use device information in our marketing campaigns for better accuracy and effectiveness.
          </p>
          <h3>Sharing your personal Information</h3>
          <p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information,
            as described
            above. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site
            — you can
            read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:
            https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:
            https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
          <p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and
            regulations, to
            respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to
            otherwise
            protect our rights.</p>
          <h3>Behavioral advertising</h3>
          <p>As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements
            or marketing
            communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted
            advertising
            works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at
            http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.</p>
          <p>You can opt out of targeted advertising by using the links below:</p>

            to use these
            opt-out tools again. Some Cookie-management solutions also rely on Cookies, so please adjust
            your browser
            Cookie settings carefully. We do not maintain or control the opt-out mechanisms and settings
            below and are not
            responsible for their operation.</p>

          <h3>Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
          <p>Most third-party advertisers offer a way to opt out of their interest-based advertising. In
            addition to the
            steps described above, you may opt-out of certain targeted advertising from participating
            entities by visiting
            the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network

              Digital Advertising Alliance</a>.</p>
          <p>You can also opt out of some of the advertising providers and vendors we use by visiting their
            settings or
            opt-out pages, such as <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank"
